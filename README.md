# United-Nations-CPAS


#### During the 7-month internship at United Nations, I worked in the team on an innovative data-driven tool -- the Comprehensive Planning Performance and Assessment System (CPAS). More specifically, I built interactive dashboards to visualize operational data with Power BI, and automated the reporting process of operational & management reports with Power BI Report Builder, and facilitated senior executives to evaluate and make data-driven strategies.

#### Our evaluation team is honoured to announce that CPAS was shortlisted in the "Innovation" category for the Secretary Generalâ€™s Awards, and has been selected to be showcased at the 2020 Paris Peace Forum!
